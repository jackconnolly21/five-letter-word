    This project is very similar in design to Finance and Mashup, so
the method for running it is very similar. No APIs were used, so no API-KEYs
are necessary. To start, run

    pip install --user -r requirements.txt

to install Flask, Flask-Session, passlib, and SQLAlchemy from requirements.txt.
There are four tables in the SQLite database "project.db" - users, games, guesses
and highscores. Their four create queries are:

    users: CREATE TABLE 'users' ('id' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, 'username' TEXT, 'hash' TEXT)
    games: CREATE TABLE 'games' ('id' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, 'mystery' TEXT, 'user_id' INTEGER)
    guesses: CREATE TABLE 'guesses' ('id' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, 'guess' TEXT, 'score' INTEGER, 'game_id' INTEGER, 'user_id' INTEGER)
    highscores: CREATE TABLE 'highscores' ('user_id' INTEGER, 'game_id' INTEGER, 'score' INTEGER, 'date' DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

so use these to configure an identical database if needed. To run the application,
use flask run in a terminal window and open CS50 IDE web server.
    To actually play the game, first register with an account and you will be
redirected to the main page, where the game lives. For rules of the game, check
out the rules tab in the navbar ("/rules"), but basically the objective is to
guess the hidden mystery word in the fewest number of guesses possible. To guess
a word, input a valid English 5 letter word into the "Guess" box on the main page,
and you will be told the number of letters your guess shares with the mystery word.
Once you win by guessing the hidden word, you can look at the highscores page to see
how to compare to others (basically me).
    Once to you win, or if you just don't feel like finishing the current game, just
click the "New Game" tab next to "Rules". You can also change your password and logout.
If you need to get back to the main page from any other route just click the "FIVE
Letters" logo to return to the game.
